Mobile Vikings for Android
=========================================================

Mobile Vikings for Android allows [Mobile Vikings](http://www.mobilevikings.be) users to check their credit data, call history and topups. The current version (0.1.3) can be found in the Android Market. Development up until that version is hosted [on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/mobilevikingsandroid).

The code hosted here on Github is written from scratch and will be released _sometime this year_. Probably.

It's all licensed under the GPL v3.
